# Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms

## Overview
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used in machine learning and data science to reduce the number of input variables in a dataset while preserving important information. It helps improve model performance, reduces computational complexity, and enhances visualization.

## Algorithms Implemented
This repository contains implementations of the following dimensionality reduction techniques:

### 1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
   - A linear transformation technique that projects data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving the variance.
   - Useful for feature extraction and noise reduction.
   - Implemented using both **manual computation** and **sklearn's PCA class**.

### 2. **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**
   - A supervised technique that finds a linear combination of features that best separate different classes.
   - Often used for classification tasks.

### 3. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
   - A non-linear dimensionality reduction technique useful for high-dimensional data visualization.
   - Captures local and global structures in data.

### 4. **Autoencoders (Deep Learning-based)**
   - A neural network-based approach for learning compact representations of data.
   - Can handle complex, non-linear relationships in data.

### 5. **Feature Selection Methods**
   - Techniques like Variance Threshold, SelectKBest, and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) are used to select the most relevant features for a given task.

## Implementation Details
- Each algorithm is implemented using **Python** with libraries like:
  - `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `tensorflow` (for autoencoders).
- Visualizations are provided to help understand the impact of dimensionality reduction.

## Applications
- **Speeding up machine learning models** by reducing the number of input features.
- **Reducing overfitting** by eliminating redundant features.
- **Improving visualization** by reducing dimensions to 2D or 3D.
- **Compressing data** while maintaining useful information.

## Example Usage
### PCA Example
```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_digits()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Apply PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=50)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X)

# Train a classifier
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_pca, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
clf = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred):.4f}')
```

## Future Work
- Implementing **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**.
- Exploring **Kernel PCA for non-linear transformations**.
- Comparing efficiency and accuracy across different datasets.
